WARNING: The files in this directory should not be edited manually, and are to
be generated by the following script: yaml_to_json.py

The json files in this directory must be updated each time after 
default_params.yaml file is updated, by simply running yaml_to_json.py

We maintain a json version of default_params.yaml file because yaml is not
included in the standard Python library.

When a PR is submitted to MOM_interface GitHub repository, Travis CI checks 
whether the yaml and json files are consistent. PRs failing this test will be
rejected.
